#### A little about Structs

A struct is an aggregate or composite data type, used for representing entities that are described by multiple attributes of potentially different types. Some examples:

- A point in 3-D space, represented by 3 real-valued coordinates x, y, and z;
- A mailing address, represented by a street name, house or apartment number, city, state, ZIP code;
- A line item in an invoice, represented by a part name or number, unit cost, quantity, and subtotal;
- A node in a tree, represented by a key, data value, left child, and right child;
- etc., etc., etc. (if your into computer science ;)

Let's look at the person as a concrete example. We could define our person type as follows:

```c
struct Person {
  char *fullName;
  int age;
  int weight;    
  int height; /* CM */
  char *nationality;
};
```

We'd create an instance of that struct like so:

`struct Person newPerson;``
and a pointer to that instance as:

`struct Person *personPointer = &newPerson;``
and access each of its fields using either the . or -> operator depending on whether we're dealing with a struct instance or a pointer to a struct:

```c
newPerson.nationality = "Canadian"
personPointer->height = 175;
```

This would be a great opportunity for you to learn about C pointers.
