#### A little about Structs

A struct is a composite data type, used for representing things that are described by multiple attributes of potentially different types. Some examples:

- A point in 3-D space, represented by 3 real-valued coordinates x, y, and z;
- A mailing address, represented by a street name, house or apartment number, city, state, ZIP code;
- A line item in an invoice, represented by a part name or number, unit cost, quantity, and subtotal;
- A node in a tree, represented by a key, data value, left child, and right child etc., etc., etc. (if your into computer science ;)

Let's look at the person as a concrete example. We define our **Person** as follows:

```c
struct Person {
  char *fullName;
  int age;
  int weight;    
  int height;
  char *nationality;
};
```

We'd create an instance of that struct like so:

`struct Person newPerson;`

And modify some of the structs attributes like so:

```c
newPerson.nationality = "Canadian";
```

see how we can access each of its fields using . operator!

Here is a full look at this struct being used in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Person {
    char *fullName;
    int age;
    int weight;
    int height;
    char *nationality;
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    struct Person newPerson;
    newPerson.nationality = "Canadian";
    printf("%s\n", newPerson.nationality);
    return 0;
}

// Output
Canadian
```

### Values & References

In C there are value types and reference types. The way we have been creating / using structs is by value. A value is an **instance** of a struct whereas a reference is a **pointer** to a struct. When you are dealing with struct by value, you are actually dealing with a copy of that struct. Take a look:

```c
struct Person {
    char *fullName;
    int age;
    int weight;
    int height;
    char *nationality;
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    struct Person newPerson;
    newPerson.nationality = "Canadian";

    struct Person secondPerson;
    secondPerson = newPerson; // Assigning first person to second person
    secondPerson.nationality = "Spanish";

    // first persons nationality remains the same
    // our second person (copy) was modified.
    printf("%s\n", newPerson.nationality);
    printf("%s\n", secondPerson.nationality);
    return 0;
}
// Output
First person: Canadian
Second person: Spanish
```

Where as a reference would modify the original struct like so:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Person {
   char *fullName;
   int age;
   int weight;
   int height;
   char *nationality;
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
   struct Person newPerson;
   newPerson.nationality = "Canadian";

   struct Person *secondPerson = &newPerson;
   secondPerson->nationality = "Spanish";
   printf("First person: %s\n", newPerson.nationality);
   printf("Second person: %s\n", secondPerson.nationality);
   return 0;
}
// Output
First person: Spanish
Second person: Spanish
```
Do you see the difference? Please take a moment to really let this sink in...

We would define a reference by creating a **pointer** to the person struct like so:

`struct Person *personPointer = &newPerson;`

and access each of its fields using -> operator.

```c
newPerson.nationality -> "Canadian";
```

This would be a great opportunity for you to learn more about C pointers.

#### C Pointers explained

**Note** Don't be alarmed because this guy is using an old school editor that doesn't look like your beautiful Mac! Just enjoy the video for it's conceptual understanding and the wonderful explanation it provides.
