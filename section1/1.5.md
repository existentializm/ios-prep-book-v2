# Decision Making

In life, we all have to make decisions. In order to make a decision we weigh out our options and so do our programs.

Here is the general form of the decision making structures found in C.

*Follow the links underneath the examples to learn more about each one.*

##### if
```c
int target = 10;
if (target == 10) {
    printf("Target is equal to 10");
}
```
> Target is equal to 10


##### if...else
```c
int target = 3;
if (target > 5) {
  printf("Target is greater than 5")
} else {
  printf("Target is less than 5")
}
```
> Target is less than 5

##### Nesting if...else

```c
int peanuts_eaten = 22;
int peanuts_in_jar = 100;
int max_peanut_limit = 50;

if (peanuts_in_jar > 80)
{
  if (peanuts_eaten < max_peanut_limit)
  {
    printf("Take as many peanuts as you want!\n", );
  }
}
else
{
  if (peanuts_eaten > peanuts_in_jar)
  {
    printf("You can't have anymore peanuts!\n", );
  }
  else
  {
    printf("Alright, just one more peanut.\n", );
  }
}
```
> Take as many peanuts as you want!

##### Switch case

```c
int mystery_number = 7;
int number_chosen;

printf("Win a prize everytime!\n");
printf("\n";
printf("Pick a number between: 1 - 5\n");
scanf("%d\n", &number_chosen); // 5
printf("Congratulations! You won a...\n");

switch(number_chosen)
{
  case 1: printf("Trip to Barbados!"); break;
  case 2: printf("A bicycle!"); break;
  case 3: printf("A meal at Timmies!"); break;
  case 4: printf("Season pass to Wonderland!"); break;
  case 5: printf("Five nights at DisneyLand!"); break;
}
```
> Five nights at DisneyLand!
