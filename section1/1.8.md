# Interacting with Users

We know **printf()** sends data to the screen. The **scanf()** function gets data from the keyboard. You must have a way to get data from your user. You can't always assign data values using assignment statements. For example, if you were writing a movie theatre program to for use throughout the country, you couldn't assign the cost of a ticket to a variable using the equals sign in your program because every theatreâ€™s ticket price could differ. Instead, you would have to ask the user of the program in each theatre location how much a ticket costs before computing a charge.

##### Switch case

1. Copy this code into a new project and test it out.

```c
int mystery_number = 7;
int number_chosen;

printf("Win a prize everytime!\n");
printf("\n";
printf("Pick a number between: 1 - 5\n");
scanf("%d\n", &number_chosen); // 5
printf("Congratulations! You won a...\n");

switch(number_chosen)
{
  case 1: printf("Trip to Barbados!"); break;
  case 2: printf("A bicycle!"); break;
  case 3: printf("A meal at Timmies!"); break;
  case 4: printf("Season pass to Wonderland!"); break;
  case 5: printf("Five nights at DisneyLand!"); break;
}
```
> Five nights at DisneyLand!

In this example we use **scanf** to read input from the user to see what number they chose to collect their prize!

Can you see now how useful reading in user input from the keyboard can be?

1. Write C program to accept a string from users and print it.
2. C program to accept a string and print out total numbers of characters.
