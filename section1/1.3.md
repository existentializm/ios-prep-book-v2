# Adding variables to your programs

No doubt you've heard that computers process data. Somehow you've got to have a way to store that data. In C, as in most programming languages, you store data in variables. A variable is nothing more than a box in your computer's memory that holds a number or a character.

Let's first do a quick review of the basic data types!

1. Create a new Xcode project - OS X Command-Line application called "Data Types"

### A note & research challenge

In this video I said that `char *name` represents the ability to store many characters and where the `char letter` could only store a single character.

- Goole what a character array in c is
- What is the difference between `char *` and just a plan old `char`?

### Challenge 2

1. What is difference between?

`char number = '3'` and `int value = 6`

2. What happens when you try to print this? Why do you think this happened?

`char number = 3`

3. Write a C program to add two numbers in c.

*You don't need to submit the answer but it's good to get used to doing some R & D. Google can be such a good friend :)*
