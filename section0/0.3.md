# ![Github](/images/github-big.png) Setting up Git
----

### Step 1

Go into the lighthouse folder and make sure that you are using the e-mail address which you used when setting up your Git account.

    git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'

**Note:** If you mistype your email, you can run this command up (use the up/down arrow keys in Terminal to cycle through history)

### Step 2

Again, make sure that this is the username which you originally used to set up your Git account.

    git config --global user.name 'Your Name'

**Note:** If you mistype your name, you can run this command up (use the up/down arrow keys in Terminal to cycle through history)

### Step 3

SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and then adding the public key to your GitHub account.

In your terminal, type the following commands:

> cd ~/.ssh

> ls -al

Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa.pub`. If you don't have either of those files go to **Configuring a New Key**. Otherwise, you can skip to **Adding Your Public Key to GitHub**.

### Configuring a New Key

To generate a new SSH key, copy and paste the text below, making sure to substitute in your email. The default settings are preferred, so when you're asked to "enter a file in which to save the key" just press enter to continue.

> eval `ssh-agent -s`

> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

You should see something like the following:

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase. Leave it blank (just hit enter without typing any other characters), as demonstrated below.

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter]
    Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter]

Which should give you something like this:

    Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com

Then add your new key to the ssh-agent:

> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

### Adding Your Public Key to GitHub

Type the following:

> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

This will give you a big block of characters which you should highlight and copy from your Terminal/PuTTy window.

In your browser, visit the [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/admin) screen on GitHub.

Click on **SSH Keys** on the left sidebar.

Click **Add SSH Key**

In the Title field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, since you're using a computer for Lighthouse, you might call this key "Your computers name"

Paste your key into the "Key" field.

Click **Add key**.

Confirm the action by entering your GitHub password.

**NOTE:** It's okay to have multiple SSH keys setup in your Github settings. It just means multiple machines have access to pull and push to Github using your account credentials.

And that's it - you've finished setting up your mac, which you will be using going forward! Give yourself a pat on the back, and now let's get to some real work! ;)
