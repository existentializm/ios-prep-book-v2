### Inheritance

One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is that of inheritance. Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and fast implementation time.

When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the base class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class.

The idea of inheritance implements the is a relationship. For example, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal, hence dog IS-A animal as well and so on.

#### Base & Derived Classes:

Objective-C allows only multilevel inheritance, i.e., it can have only one base class but allows multilevel inheritance. All classes in Objective-C is derived from the superclass NSObject.

`@interface derived-class: base-class`

Consider a base class Person and its derived class Employee as follows:

```c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Person : NSObject {
    NSString *personName;
    NSInteger personAge;
}
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age;
- (void)print;
@end

@implementation Person

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age{
    personName = name;
    personAge = age;
    return self;
}

- (void)print{
    NSLog(@"Name: %@", personName);
    NSLog(@"Age: %ld", personAge);
}
@end

@interface Employee : Person {
    NSString *employeeEducation;
}
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age
  andEducation:(NSString *)education;
- (void)print;
@end

@implementation Employee

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name andAge:(NSInteger)age
  andEducation: (NSString *)education {
    personName = name;
    personAge = age;
    employeeEducation = education;
    return self;
}

- (void)print {
    NSLog(@"Name: %@", personName);
    NSLog(@"Age: %ld", personAge);
    NSLog(@"Education: %@", employeeEducation);
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]){
    @autoreleasepool {
      NSLog(@"Base class Person Object");
      Person *person = [[Person alloc]initWithName:@"Raj" andAge:5];
      [person print];
      NSLog(@"Inherited Class Employee Object");
      Employee *employee = [[Employee alloc]initWithName:@"Raj"
      andAge:5 andEducation:@"MBA"];
      [employee print];
    }        
    return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

```
2016-08-20 21:20:09.842 Inheritance[349:303] Base class Person Object
2016-08-20 21:20:09.844 Inheritance[349:303] Name: Raj
2016-08-20 21:20:09.844 Inheritance[349:303] Age: 5
2016-08-20 21:20:09.845 Inheritance[349:303] Inherited Class Employee Object
2016-08-20 21:20:09.845 Inheritance[349:303] Name: Raj
2016-08-20 21:20:09.846 Inheritance[349:303] Age: 5
2016-08-20 21:20:09.846 Inheritance[349:303] Education: MBA
```
