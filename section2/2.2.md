### Foundation

Building apps for iOS is different than making programs in C. The bulk of the work is actually not done by us. It's done by engineers at Apple and other companies alike. They develop the [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) that we use in order to build apps for the iOS platform.

>*"The Foundation framework defines a base layer of Objective-C classes. In addition to providing a set of useful >primitive object classes, it introduces several paradigms that define functionality not covered by the Objective-C language."*
- [The Foundation Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/).

The Foundation framework includes all the basic objects we need to accomplish our tasks. Some classes represent basic data types like strings and arrays while others represent information like dates. It even gets as sophisticated as objects that allow us to communicate over a network (the internet).

The most important class in Foundation is called `NSObject` and it's where all the other classes come from. Think `NSObject` like the root of your Family Tree. It's where everything started.

Let's take a detour and go over this reading about [Classes](http://rypress.com/tutorials/objective-c/classes)!
