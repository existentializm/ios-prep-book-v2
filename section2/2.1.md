### Objective-C Primer

Objective-C is the language you will use to create iOS apps. The language has a really interesting history you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C).

Writing an Objective-C program is very similar to a C program. Take this **Hello World** program as an example:

### The breakdown

Similar to our first C program an Objective-C program starts by importing a library in order for us to access things like `NSLog`. In our C program we used `printf` but we did not write the code that makes `printf` output what we want to the console. The standard C library `stdio` allows us to do that. Same goes for Objective-C except **Foundation** (one of Apple's frameworks) does most of the heavy lifting for us.

`#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>`

The main function is the exact same in Objective-C. The only difference is the use of something called an @autoreleasepool. Don't worry to much about that for now, it has to do with managing memory and you will learn all about it in class. Stay with me...

```c
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
  @autoreleasepool {

  }
}
```

Right inside our `@autoreleasepool` we use something called `NSLog` which is the **Foundation** equivalent for C's **stdio** `printf`. It does everything `printf` does and more:

- `NSLog` adds a timestamp and identifier to the output, whereas printf will not;
- When performed on physical device, NSLog statements appear in the device's console whereas `printf` only appears in the debugger console. (More about this in class.)

```c
NSLog(@"Hello, World!\n");
```

One of of the first things I asked myself when I encountered `NSLog` was the use of the @ sign. Why? It's how Objective-C strings are differentiated from C Strings. Let's keep it at that.

Notice the similarities?
